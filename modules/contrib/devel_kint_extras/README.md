t# Devel Kint Extras

## UPDATE (2025): Module no longer works with Devel

This module was made specifically to enhance Devel's integration with Kint.
That Kint integration
[was removed from Devel in v5.4.0](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel/releases/5.4.0),
however, so this module is now obsolete.

Instead, you can install the standalone [Kint module](https://www.drupal.org/project/kint).
Feel free to create issues in the [Kint module's issue queue](https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/kint) for any
of this module's functionalities that you would want ported over there.

See [this issue](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel_kint_extras/issues/3535663)
for more information.
